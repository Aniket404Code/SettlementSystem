# Modular Settlement System (Unreal Engine 5 C++)

## Overview
This project implements a modular and scalable Settlement System using Unreal Engine 5 and C++. The system is designed using proper OOP principles and component-based architecture, similar to industry-level RTS game design.

There are two types of settlements:

- Major Settlement – Contains buildings and can construct new buildings.
- Minor Settlement – Automatically produces resources at fixed intervals.

Buildings require resources to construct and generate resources over time once built.
